# Phonebook backend

The exercises in this part of the course consist of creating a REST backend for the frontend UI that was built in the previous section. It needs its own repository, thus it is not included in the main repo and can instead be found [here](https://github.com/AhmedBenAbdessalam/FullStackOpen-part3).
